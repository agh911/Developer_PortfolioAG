# Challenge 02 Working With CSS: Portfolio

## Description 

This web application was built as a means to show case my skills as a future front-end web developer. I was also able to better understand principles underlying responsive design, flex-box, grid as well as how to use CSS to style a page, and finally to create a place to display my current and future projects.
